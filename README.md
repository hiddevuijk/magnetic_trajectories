# magnetic_trajectories

Program to get trajectories Brownian particles in 
a magnetic field, both with mass and overdampend.

THe static var. in box_muller are no longer used
because they interfere with the other parallel 
simulations for different masses. This means that
only one of the two random numbers is used.
